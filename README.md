## Quick Setup (TL;DR)

1. Clone or download this seed project
2. `cd` to the project's root directory and run `npm install`
3. To start the [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpa   ck-dev-server.html) run `npm run dev`
  * The server will start on port 3000 by default or you can set the environment variable `PORT` to choose your own.
  * Browsing to that port will serve the app, changes made to files will automatically be reflected in the browser.
4. To build out all files for production run `npm run build`
 * All files will be built out to `_dist` and can be deployed to your server's webroot for hosting.  To do a quick test you can run a local server easily in node or, if you have python installed, run:
    * (Python 2.x) `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
    * (Python 3.x) `python -m http.server`
